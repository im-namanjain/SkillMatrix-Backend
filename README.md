This code will work only with the local server with the help of XAMPP.

You can run this code by pasting this folder in the Xampp > htdocx section.
Before that you have to create a database name course_db in localhost/phpmyadmin in web browser
You can use the code from course_db.sql for creating the database.

After this you have to open your brower and search for localhost/skillmatrix or the name of the folder you have written
